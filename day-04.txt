Set up Bucket and Object Permissions
Goal: Learn about several ways to allow or restrict access to a bucket and its objects.

By default, AWS only allows the resource owner or the account owner access to resources. 
This means all created resources are private by default.

In case we need to provide access to the bucket to other services or users, 
there are multiple access management features available in S3 that allow authorized access.

AWS recommends following the principle of least privilege while granting permissions. 
This means we only grant permissions that are necessary to perform any specific task instead of 
granting full access rights.

Access management features in S3
(i) AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)
(ii) Bucket policies
(ii) Access control list (ACL)

Understand Bucket Policies
Learn more about managing permissions using bucket policies.

The components of a bucket policy
An S3 bucket policy can be created in JSON. Its main components are as follows:

Resources: These are AWS S3 resources to which we provide access-based permissions.

Actions: We can provide permission to perform any particular action on an S3 bucket, 
such as s3:GetObject.

Effect: We can apply either the Allow or Deny effect when an action is requested on the resource.

Principal: This lists the AWS user, account, service, or role to which the set of permissions is 
being provided.

Sample bucket policy
//---------------------

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AddCannedAcl",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::829331163733:user/abmishra"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::abi-demo-bucket-01/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "s3:x-amz-acl": "public-read"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

//------------------------

Add a bucket policy using the AWS CLI:
[cloudshell-user@ip-10-0-65-146 ~]$ aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket abi-demo-bucket-01 --policy s3-policy.json
For Deleting the policy attached with bucket:
[cloudshell-user@ip-10-0-65-146 ~]$ aws s3api delete-bucket-policy --bucket abi-demo-bucket-01

//-------------------------------
Another example to delete the bucket using CLI

[cloudshell-user@ip-10-0-65-146 ~]$ aws s3 mb s3://abi-demo-bucket-01 --region ap-south-1
make_bucket: abi-demo-bucket-01
[cloudshell-user@ip-10-0-65-146 ~]$ aws s3api delete-bucket --bucket abi-demo-bucket-01
[cloudshell-user@ip-10-0-65-146 ~]$ aws s3 ls
[cloudshell-user@ip-10-0-65-146 ~]$
