Manage a bucket ACL with the AWS CLI
Command:
aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket BUCKET_NAME [options] 
Here, options include the following:
private
public-read
public-read-write
authenticated-read
The --access-control-policy option allows the inclusion of ACL configuration in the JSON format.
The --grant-full-control option grants permission to list and write objects and read and write bucket ACL access.
The --grant-read option allows list-objects access.
The --grant-read-acp option grants permission to read the bucket ACL.
The --grant-write option grants permission to write the objects.
The --grant-write-acp option grants permission to write the bucket ACL.

Example 1:
aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket my-pets --acl public-read

Example 2:
aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket my-pets --grant-read uri=http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers

Presigned URLs
Learn about presigned URLs in AWS S3.

What’s a presigned URL?
Suppose we want to grant temporary access to an object in an S3 bucket to someone who doesn’t have 
an AWS account. At the same time, we don’t want to make our object public.
How can we do that?

To achieve this, we can use the feature of presigned URLs.
This allows us to share objects or enable upload to an S3 bucket by users 
without needing credentials or permissions.

A presigned URL generates a temporary access URL that users can use to access an object or a bucket until the 
URL reaches its expiration time and stops working.

This will be predefined by you while creating a presigned URL.

We can create a presigned URL using the AWS CLI or SDK (software development kit).

Presigned URL for sharing an object using the AWS CLI

In this example, we share an object that contains an image using a presigned URL 
that expires after two minutes.

Command:
[cloudshell-user@ip-10-0-34-29 ~]$ aws s3 mb s3://abi-demo-bucket-01 --region ap-south-1
make_bucket: abi-demo-bucket-01
[cloudshell-user@ip-10-0-34-29 ~]$ aws s3 cp demo1.txt s3://abi-demo-bucket-01
upload: ./demo1.txt to s3://abi-demo-bucket-01/demo1.txt        
[cloudshell-user@ip-10-0-34-29 ~]$ aws s3 presign s3://abi-demo-bucket-01/demo1.txt --expires-in 120

S3 URL Breakdown

Virtual hosted-style URLs

In a virtual hosted-style URL the bucket name is present within the URL as a subdomain of the URL
This allows every bucket to be present as a unique DNS subdomain in the URL.

Example:
https://abi-demo-bucket-01.s3.amazonaws.com/demo1.txt

There are 03 different sub-sections of this url
Bucket: abi-demo-bucket-01
s3 Endpint: s3.amazonaws
object: demo1.txt

In the example above, we see that the bucket name abi-demo-bucket-01 is a subdomain 
in the URL with the S3 endpoint s3.amazonaws.com. It also references the demo1.txt object 
within the bucket.

The same example you can see in most the google services, for ex:
calendar.google.com, drive.google.com


In the past, AWS S3 used path-style URLs, where the bucket name was present as a path after
s3.amazonaws.com.

Example
https://s3.amazonaws.com/abi-demo-bucket-01/demo1.txt

However, AWS S3 has deprecated the use of the path-style URL pattern 
and now uses only the virtual hosted-style URL pattern for all the buckets.

//------------------------

Static website endpoint

A static-hosted website is always region specific and can be accessed using the region-specific endpoint.

Based on the S3 bucket region, the website endpoint will follow one of the following formats.

Dash format
In the dash format, the keyword s3-website and the region name are separated by a dash.
Example: 
http://abi-demo-bucket-01.s3-website-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com

Dot format
In the dot format, the keyword s3-website and the region name are separated by a dot.
Example: 
http://abi-demo-bucket-01.s3-website.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com
